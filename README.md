# jira-agile-statistics

This resulted out of a script to get some Sprint Statistics out of our Jira Board with Agile Plugin, 
using the Python Jira Rest Client (https://github.com/pycontribs/jira) and relying on custom JQL queries. 

Since Jira is abundantly customizable and used in very different ways it is not an out-of-the box project that will run for everyone. 
This is mainly provided as a starting point to customize and adapt to your own Jira configuration.
